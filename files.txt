~/:
CHECKSUMS.md5 ~ md5sums of other files except themselves-like
FILELIST.TXT ~ location of MANIFEST.bz2 -> categories
PACKAGES.TXT ~ pkg description ;; only for pkgs in ./slackware(64)/ dir 

$DIR/:
CHECKSUMS.md5 ~ md5sums of pkgs ;; could be used for diff -> replace changed pkg
FILE_LIST ~ pkg list ;; txz-txt-asc -> filter ;; not needed at all
MANIFEST.bz2 ~ pkg contents ;; and likely $DIR contents
PACKAGES.TXT ~ pkg desc ;; this is optional file !!!

Ideas:
ChangeLog.txt


pouzit diff - nejak
'-' -> db-pkg-remove.pl slackver pkgname
'+' -> db-pkg-add.pl slackver pkgname

* check for new && removed
* check for modified (MD5) -> merge n&r before?

# README:

Files ending with .md5 aren't stored simply because there is no 
reason why to do so. There is no md5 for them, although we could 
generate one. Hm. Well-
Other data files in DB serve as helpers in case something happens 
with stored data files, yet if that happens, it means we can only 
tell if something has changed or not. In other words, we will have 
to dump whole Slackware version from DB and start over.

## Perl and Shell scripts
The purpose of shell scripts is to prepare field for Perl ones.
