* parse only FILELIST (or whatever) and create SQL batch, so .sq3 for
 specific distro can be created; no updates/deletes - whole file
* debug, may be global debug option
* force update - compare each package, update each package, whatever
* replace all COUNT(*) with something more apropriate
* unified config(s) for all scripts and what-not
* diffs like in % diff; for each change in changelog
* PKG availability at mirror
* Slackversion browser; slackvers -> cats -> pkgs
