* parse and update only package descriptions
* parse only FILELIST (or whatever) and create SQL batch, so .sq3 for
 specific distro can be created; no updates/deletes - whole file
 in other words an [SQL] batch file for PgSQL an SQLite
* force update - compare each package, update each package, whatever
* diffs like in % diff; for each change in changelog
* PKG availability at mirror
* input focus order ~ what to look for -> in what -> version; search form
* changelogs at web ~ offer PNG|TXT|HTML
* ENH: write syncer for country flags
* ENH: BE ~ debug, may be global debug option
* ENH: auto add new Slackware version [backend]
* ENH: add ^..$ regexp to limit the search, or "complete" regex support
* FIX: browser ~ back links on error
@ Slackversion browser; slackvers -> cats -> pkgs
@ hide/show quick search at certain pages eg. search in search is useless ~
negatory due layout shifting around
@ BUG: error doesn't work!
@ BUG: new URL path and non-encoded serie name in URL
@ ENH: add flags next to mirror locations
@ keep cat + f/p + slackver selection after each search!
@ replace all COUNT(*) with something more apropriate ~ done where could be
@ unified config(s) for all scripts and what-not ~ done even in Perl
